# 📈 Day 5 – Cumulative Sales Using Window Functions

### ✅ What I Learned:
- `OVER (PARTITION BY)` to separate countries
- `ORDER BY` inside window to maintain date sequence
- Used `SUM()` as a **running total** (cumulative sales)

### 🔍 Use Case:
Track how each country’s revenue grows over time, great for monthly or weekly dashboards.
