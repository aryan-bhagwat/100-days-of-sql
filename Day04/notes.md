# 🔗 Day 4 – SQL JOINs for Order + Product Details

### ✅ What I Learned:
- How to use `JOIN` between two related tables (`Orders` and `Products`)
- How to calculate `TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice`
- Filtered out invalid quantities (`> 0`)
- Aliased tables for cleaner SQL (`o`, `p`)

### 🔍 Use Case:
Use JOINs to enrich transactional tables with product info (like names) for reporting.
